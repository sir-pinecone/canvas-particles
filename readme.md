Canvas Particles
================
It's a simple system for creating particle effects in an HTML5 Canvas.

Open up the particles.html file to see an example. 

Browser Support
===============
Your browser must support Canvas and have a pretty good JavaScript engine. I got the best results in Chrome 14. You also need a pretty good CPU to not have any lag. I'm testing on an overclocked i-5 2500k. I'm sure there are many improvements I can make to the code to make it more efficient. All in due time :)

Todo
====
* Make the particle emitters more standalone. 
* Add page controls to modify emitter settings
* Create your own emitters on the fly and save them to local storage.
* Turn this into a game of some sort :D
